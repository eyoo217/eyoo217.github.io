## projects
### gigamap - port scanning tool
[repo link](https://github.com/eyoo217/gigamap)

- gigamap is a port scanner inspired by the nmap scanner that returns any open ports on a network.
- gigamap takes in a website url or an ip address as a parameter and returns open ports and the ports status.
- to run, install the main.go file make sure go is installed (you can test this by typing go version) run "go run main.go"
- now you can scan ports with ease using gigamap!
