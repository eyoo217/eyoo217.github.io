🧑‍💻 i'm a sophomore at DePaul University

💻 my current focus is software and application development

🧮 i'm interested in the world of software, finance and mathematics

# 🗣️ Who I Am

during highschool i took courses on computer science and fell in love with the creative aspect of computer science and programming. i decided to pursue computer science and programming in college and a career. my dream is to be able to combine my passion of math and computer science and spend my life on the pursuit of knowledge. 

i just wrapped up an internship at Wintrust Financial where i helped plan and build out a cloud migration for our largest on-prem applications. i also wrote unit tests for some .NET packages we were maintaining as well. 

# 🕺 Right Now
