# 🗣️ Who I Am

during highschool i took courses on computer science and fell in love with the creative aspect of computer science and programming. i decided to pursue computer science and programming in college and a career. my dream is to be able to combine my passion of math and computer science and spend my life on the pursuit of knowledge. specifically right now i am learning about machine learning to hack together some ideas i've been sitting on. 

currently i am an incoming intern at Kodai Capital Management in Chicago where I will be working in the technology department focusing on computer hardware as well as system management.

i'm also deep in the competitive gaming community and recently picked up a hobby for computer peripherals. i also make some valorant content on my twitter and youtube

you can probably catch me playing some beach volleyball, gaming, running on lake shore, or attempting to grasp youtube lectures on computer science.
