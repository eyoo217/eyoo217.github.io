🧑‍💻 i'm a sophomore at DePaul University

💻 my current focus is software and application development

🧮 i'm interested in the world of software and mathematics

# 🗣️ Who I Am

during highschool i took courses on computer science and fell in love with the creative aspect of computer science and programming. i decided to pursue computer science and programming in college and a career. my dream is to be able to combine my passion of math and computer science and spend my life on the pursuit of knowledge. 

i wrapped up my internship at Kodai Capital Management in August where I worked on IT and security operations as well as databases with the engineering department. i created a test that can be run on any dbt model that checks the freshness of data and alerts if data has not arrived by an expected time. i also developed a strategy for asset management to better maintain tracking of our assets as well as assignment of assets within offices across Chicago and New York.

these past couple months ive been diving deep into building projects and applications. during spring break, i spent every day coding and working on a project everyday.

i made:
HotGirlWalk - Travel Optimizer: a website that will tell you the most optimal route based on distance and travel time while also considering travel costs.
uber and lyft refused to give me an access token for their api, so i made an algorithm that will estimate the uber fare based on distance and travel duration. (it actually is decently accurate as well)

DePaul Rice Purity Test: based on the viral rice purity test from rice university, i made a version specifically tailored to DePaul and the surrounding Chicago area. 
50+ users and submissions within an hour of launch and still counting!
