# 🗣️ Who I Am

during highschool i took courses on computer science and fell in love with the creative aspect of computer science and programming. i decided to pursue computer science and programming in college and a career. my dream is to be able to combine my passion of math and computer science and spend my life on the pursuit of knowledge. specifically right now i am learning about machine learning to hack together some ideas i've been sitting on. 

i just wrapped up my internship at Kodai Capital Management in August where I worked on IT and security operations as well as databases with the engineering department. i created a test that can be run on any dbt model that checks the freshness of data and alerts if data has not arrived by an expected time. i also developed a strategy for asset management to better maintain tracking of our assets as well as assignment of assets within offices across Chicago and New York.

i'm also deep in the competitive gaming community and recently picked up a hobby for computer peripherals. i also make some valorant content on my twitter and youtube
